            <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Einstein's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born in Ulm, Germany</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1895</strong> - Moves to Switzerland, forsaking his German citizenship the following year in
                    the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1901</strong> - Acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life and renounced
                    his citizenship . Secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent
                    office, as an assistant
                    examiner – level III. Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a
                    gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office
                    became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he "fully mastered machine
                    technology".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1905</strong> - He was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich, with his dissertation "A
                    New Determination of Molecular Dimensions". Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein's annus
                    mirabilis (amazing year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect,
                    Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him
                    to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1908</strong> - Recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the
                    University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the
                    relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for
                    a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in
                    1909.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1922</strong> - His travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month
                    excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of
                    lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at
                    the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his
                    impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for
                    art.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1930</strong> - Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a
                    two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the
                    national attention, he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to
                    protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak
                    publicly, he declined them all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1933</strong> - In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he
                    could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor,
                    Adolf Hitler. Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from
                    holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton
                    describes how, with "virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues", thousands of
                    Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were
                    removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1939</strong> - A group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd
                    attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were
                    discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner,
                    "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists
                    might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to
                    resort to such a weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1940</strong> - Became an American citizen. Not long after settling into his career at the
                    Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the
                    meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1946</strong> - visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college,
                    where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to
                    grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall.
                    Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."
                </li>
                <li><strong>1955</strong> - Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal
                    aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He
                    took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of
                    Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete
                    it.

                    "The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible
                    a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No
                    interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like
                    all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to
                    whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for
                    me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them."
